Battleship Project:
This project is a fully playable Battleship game with 4 difficulties. The difficulties range from easy, to medium, to hard, to ultra, with a 5x5, a 7x7, a 10x10 and 13x13 playing field respectively. The game has a variety of ships and ship sizes depending on the chosen difficulty. The player is able to place their own ships in any way they want without problem and is playing against a pc who does the same. In order to simulate the ship placement of the actual Battleships game that was popularized with its 10x10 playing field, the PC places its ships in any direction and in any proximity to its own ships in order to confuse the player.
